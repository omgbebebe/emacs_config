Purpose:

To provide a pleasant mode to browse and edit Haskell files, linking
into the following supported modules:

`haskell-font-lock', Graeme E Moss and Tommy Thorn
  Fontifies standard Haskell keywords, symbols, functions, etc.

`haskell-decl-scan', Graeme E Moss
  Scans top-level declarations, and places them in a menu.

`haskell-doc', Hans-Wolfgang Loidl
  Echoes types of functions or syntax of keywords when the cursor is idle.

`haskell-indentation', Kristof Bastiaensen
  Intelligent semi-automatic indentation, mark two.

`haskell-indent', Guy Lapalme
  Intelligent semi-automatic indentation.

`haskell-simple-indent', Graeme E Moss and Heribert Schuetz
  Simple indentation.

`inf-haskell'
  Interaction with an inferior Haskell process.
  It replaces the previous two modules:
    `haskell-hugs', Guy Lapalme
    `haskell-ghci', Chris Web


This mode supports full Haskell 1.4 including literate scripts.
In some versions of (X)Emacs it may only support Latin-1, not Unicode.

This mode is based on an editing mode by Simon Marlow 11/1/92
and heavily modified by Graeme E Moss and Tommy Thorn 7/11/98.

If you have any problems or suggestions specific to a supported
module, consult that module for a list of known bugs, and an
author to contact via email.  For general problems or suggestions,
consult the list below, then email gem@cs.york.ac.uk and
thorn@irisa.fr quoting the version of the mode you are using, the
version of Emacs you are using, and a small example of the problem
or suggestion.
